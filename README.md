# Datathon 2024 - Team Revolt

Welcome to the repository for Team Revolt's submission to the Datathon 2024 competition, organized by the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT). This project focuses on anomaly detection using linear regression and other analytical techniques.

## Project Overview

Our project aimed to detect anomalies in the provided dataset by analyzing patterns and deviations. Anomaly detection is critical for applications like fraud detection, system monitoring, and predictive maintenance. This repository contains our workflow, datasets, and visualizations.

## Repository Contents

- **Datasets**: Raw and processed datasets used for analysis.
- **Notebooks**: Code files showcasing data preprocessing, EDA, and anomaly detection models.
- **Visualizations**: Power BI dashboards for anomaly representation.
- **Documentation**: Problem statements and analysis summaries.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers.
- Feature normalization: Ensured smooth model performance.
- Data integration: Combined datasets for a holistic analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions.
- Identified trends and anomalies.

### 3. Anomaly Detection Techniques
- **Linear Regression**: Modeled normal patterns to detect deviations.
- **Statistical Methods**: Used z-scores for outlier identification.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Identified anomalous groups using unsupervised methods.

### 4. Visualization
- Created interactive dashboards in Power BI for intuitive anomaly detection.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VimukthiPahasaraGodage/Datathon_24_Team_Revolt.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure all required Python packages are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Analysis
Open and execute the Jupyter Notebook for detailed insights:
```bash
jupyter notebook Revolt_Datathon_Notebook.ipynb
```

### 4. Explore Visualizations
Open the Power BI file `anomalies.pbix` to view detected anomalies and patterns.
